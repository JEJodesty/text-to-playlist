# text-to-playlist
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that generates a Spotify playlist from a string search parameter.

Example:

Parsed phrases from the poem 'if i can't let it go out of my mind' are used as search
parameters for tracks.
These tracks were used to generate a public playlist on my Spotify account entitled ["Text2Playlist"](http://open.spotify.com/user/joshej07/playlist/7kDXe7RglYSNoVhiKdOMzV).

Phrases from 'if i can't let it go out of my mind':
* go out of
* can't let it
* of my mind
* if i can't
* i can't let
* out of my
* let it go
* it go out
